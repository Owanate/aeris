## My Process
Skyline is built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The app is structured using the CSS architecture BEM(Block Element Model). It is a fully responsive web application that works on desktop and mobile devices.

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to effectively use BEM, using it to effectively structure my HTML code. I also learned how to use JavaScript fetch and async functions. I was able to use some of my knowledge on web accessibility.
